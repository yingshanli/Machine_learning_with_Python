    "# Season Prediction Using HMM\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this experiment is to understand how to leverage the solutions of the four HMM problems (evaluation, smoothing, most likely explanation and learning) for creating a predictor program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We will develop a program for predicting seasons. For simplicity we assume that there are only two seasons: Rainy & Dry.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that the seasons cannot be observed directly, i.e., they are hidden. However, a season can be predicted by observing some actions. For example, by observing the pattern of using umbrellas the hidden season can be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we assume that there are only two observable states: Umbrella and No Umbrella\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, by observing umbrellas (or no umbrellas) at an interval of a day, we intend to predict the hidden season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in rainy season people carry umbrella more often than in a dry season. Therefore, the pattern of carrying umbrella differs based on seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge in solving this problem is that the HMM model (state transition probability matrix, emission probability matrix and the initial state probability matrix) is unknown. Because of the difference in the pattern of using umbrella in the two seasons, we need two HMMs for modeling the Rainy and Dry season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to be able to predict the hidden season based on the observation about umbrella, we need to learn two HMMs for the Rainy and Dry season.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to solve the following two problems:\n",
    "1. Learn two HMMs for the Rainy and Dry seasons (this is a Learning problem, which is Problem 4 from the Lecture slides)\n",
    "2. Evaluate a sequence of observations using the two HMMs (this is an Evaluation problem, which is Problem 1 from the Lecture slides)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two problems are solved as follows:\n",
    "1. The learning problem is solved by Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. The EM method is implemented by the Baum-Welch algorithm.\n",
    "2. The evaluation problem is solved by using the Forward algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two APIs to solve these two problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## HmmLearn API\n",
    "https://hmmlearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learning:\n",
    "We will use this API to learn the two HMMs from two long sequence of observations (about umbrellas) collected from Rainy and Dry seasons, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evaluation:\n",
    "Then, we will use this API to evaluate any given sequence of observations. Based on the evaluation scores, we will predict the more probable season.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use another API for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hidden_markov API\n",
    "https://pypi.org/project/hidden_markov/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evaluation:\n",
    "We will use this API to evaluate any given sequence of observations. Then, based on the evaluation score, we will predict the more probable season.\n"
